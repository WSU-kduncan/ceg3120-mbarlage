**Setup**
Packages
- pip3 install -U discord.py==2.0.1
- python3.8

How to get an API token
- Visit discord developer portal and create a new app (your discord bot) 
- Go to Settings -> Bot -> Build-A-Bot -> Token (you can reset it here also)
- put the token in a .env file that stays private!!

**Usage**
- I made a change that sends 2 pictures of each of my dogs when the command "dogs" is typed into the server. I used the link you provided to help me with this

**Research**
you may have realized that it is lame that the bot only runs when you run the program - it turns off if you disconnect or need to switch tasks.
In the real world, things are "always on", not waiting for Bob to turn his PC on and make sure the program is running.
Research some possible solutions that would solve this, and discuss why you think it would work.
