**Setup**

Packages
- pip3 install -U discord.py==2.0.1
- python3.8

How to get an API token
- Visit discord developer portal and create a new app (your discord bot) 
- Go to Settings -> Bot -> Build-A-Bot -> Token (you can reset it here also)
- put the token in a .env file that stays private!!

**Usage**
- I made a change that sends 2 pictures of each of my dogs when the command "dogs" is typed into the server. I used the link you provided to help me with this

**Research**
- To keep the bot running, we could run it from the cloud instead of a local system. This way it could run 24/7 I'm sure there's a way to do it with AWS or other remote instances
